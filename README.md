# Data Science

Welcome to my **Data Science** repository!  

This repository is a growing collection of data science projects I’m building over time to practice, learn, and showcase key skills in data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and more.

## 📂 Repository Overview

Here you will find projects covering topics such as:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning models
- Deep learning experiments
- Data visualization and dashboards
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Each project will have its own folder with:
- A clear description (`README.md`)
- Code notebooks/scripts (`.ipynb`, `.py`)
- Data (if permitted or with instructions to obtain it)
- Results, visualizations, or reports

## 📈 Goals

- Improve my data science and machine learning skills  
- Share reproducible and well-documented projects  
- Build a portfolio just for fun

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ifilipechau/data-science.git
    ```

2. Navigate into a project folder and follow its README for setup and execution details.
